# Project: Fast React Pizza Co.

![App Screenshot] (./assets/pizza-menu.png)

A simple and responsive pizza menu built with the React library. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of creating React components, passing props, conditional rendering, and handling lists.

## Overview

This application displays a menu of pizzas with their names, ingredients, prices, and images. It also indicates when a pizza is sold out and informs about the pizzeria's opening hours, allowing (in the future) for online ordering.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JSX:** A syntax extension to JavaScript recommended for use with React.
- **CSS:** For styling the components (the `index.css` file is included).

## Key Learning Points

- Conditional rendering using the ternary operator to show alternative UI elements.
- Using template literals for dynamic class names in JSX.
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- Handling lists and keys properly when rendering arrays in React.
- Managing component props for reusable and clean code.

## How to Run Locally

1.  Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
2.  Clone this repository to your computer:
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/saleh-coder/pizza-menu.git>
    ```
3.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd pizza-menu
    ```
4.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
5.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
6.  Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application running.

## Current Features

- Display of a list of pizzas with name, ingredients, price, and image.
- Visual indication of sold-out pizzas.
- Information about the pizzeria's opening hours.
- An "Order" button (future functionality).

## Planned Next Steps

- Implement the functionality of the "Order" button.
- Add a shopping cart.
- Improve styling and responsiveness.
- Potentially integrate data from a backend.

## Learning

This project is part of my React learning journey and serves as practice for understanding component lifecycle, data manipulation, and building dynamic interfaces.

## Contribution

As this is a personal learning project, external contributions are not expected at this time.
